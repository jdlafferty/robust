\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discuss}

In this paper we introduced the problem of model repair, related it to robust estimation, and established a series of results showing the theoretical performance of a repair algorithm that is based on median regression. The specific models treated include linear models and families of neural networks trained using gradient descent. The experimental results largely validate the theory, quantifying how model repair requires over-parameterization in the model and redundancy in the estimator.

This work suggests several directions to explore in future research.  A natural problem is to establish lower bounds for  model repair. In particular, our results show the level of over-parameterization sufficient for repair algorithms based on $\ell_1$ optimization. What level is required if the algorithm is not specified? Answering this question might exploit the rich literature on depth functions and multivariate generalizations of the median, together with

%% show sims of quantile regression?
