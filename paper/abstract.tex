We study the robustness properties of median regression for linear models when outliers are present in the measurement error or noise. In the high dimensional and sparse setting, the loss function is combined with an $\ell_1$-norm penalty on model parameters.  We analyze the estimation and prediction error of the estimator with respect to sample size, model dimension, and a measure of the correlation between the predictor variables. In contrast to classical robust regression under the Huber model for corrupted design, we find that median regression yields consistent estimation even when an arbitrarily large proportion of the response values have been corrupted by outliers, without any assumption on the corrupting distribution. Simulation studies are presented that support and illustrate the theoretical findings.
